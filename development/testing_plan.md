# Testing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the ManyChatBot website and integration system to ensure quality, reliability, and optimal performance.

## Testing Types & Methodology

### 1. Functional Testing

#### User Interface Testing
- Verify all UI elements display and function correctly
- Test form validation and submission
- Confirm navigation and linking functions
- Validate responsive design across devices
- Test interactive elements (accordions, tooltips, sliders)

#### Integration Testing
- Test ManyChat API connections
- Verify Make.com workflow functionality
- Test booking system integration
- Validate form submissions to backend systems
- Verify email notifications and automated responses

#### End-to-End Testing
- Complete user journey testing (visit → capture → book)
- Test the full client onboarding process
- Verify payment processing
- Test notification systems
- Validate data flow across all integrated systems

### 2. Non-Functional Testing

#### Performance Testing
- Page load speed optimization
- API response time measurement
- Form submission latency testing
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Stress testing under high traffic conditions

#### Security Testing
- Form vulnerability assessment
- XSS and CSRF protection verification
- API security testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Data encryption validation

#### Accessibility Testing
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast verification
- Focus state visibility testing

## Testing Schedule

| Phase | Testing Activities | Timeline | Responsible |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Pre-Development | Requirements validation | Week 1 | Project Manager |
| Development - Iteration 1 | Unit testing, Component testing | Week 3 | Developers |
| Development - Iteration 2 | Integration testing, API verification | Week 5 | QA Specialist |
| Pre-Launch | Full system testing, UAT, Performance | Week 7 | QA Team |
| Post-Launch | Monitoring, A/B testing, Optimization | Week 8+ | Project Team |

## Bug Tracking & Resolution

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Prevents core functionality, no workaround
- **High**: Significant impact on functionality, workaround possible
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, non-core functionality affected
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic defects

### Bug Tracking Process
1. Bug identification and documentation
2. Severity and priority assignment
3. Developer assignment
4. Bug resolution
5. Verification testing
6. Closure and documentation

### Regression Testing
- Conduct after each bug fix
- Ensure fix does not impact other functionality
- Verify original issue is completely resolved
- Document test results

## Acceptance Criteria

### Website Acceptance
- All pages load correctly on major browsers
- Responsive design functions on all target devices
- Forms validate and submit data correctly
- Navigation functions properly
- Content is accurate and well-formatted

### Integration Acceptance
- ManyChat receives and processes lead data
